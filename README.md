# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Classification-using-KNN-Random-Forest-and-Gradient-Boosting
The dataset consist of customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers including additional information of the flight.
Data analysis also included in this project. We use KNN, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for the machine learning model because the dataset have several outliers in its features.
We also add data normalization (standard scaler) to improve KNN performance.

From this research we can conclude that tree based models performance is better than non tree based models. The tree based models performs really well without any normalization. It proves that tree based model is robust with outlier. Meanwhile KNN needs data normalization to handle the outliers before achieving the best evaluation score. It is because the behaviour of KNN is sensitive with outlier and the scale of the input features. For this three models, the slightly imbalanced dataset is not affecting too much to their performance.
